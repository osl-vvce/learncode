## Problem solving

Problem Solving is the way a person apply his analytical skills in solving situation with a convenient approach. 
It is called as competitive programming as several persons are competing to solve the given issue with their 
programming skills.

### Steps to solve a problem :
There are only two steps needed in problem solving. They are :
1. Understand the given situation or problem clearly.
2. Then, put your idea to solve in the form of code.

### Platforms to practice :
There are online judges which conduct coding contests regularly to improve coding skills. Short contests last for 3-5 
hours, whereas long contests last for 10 days to one month. Even there are contests that will be conducted for a much 
more long period. 

Few of the coding platforms are:

1. Topcoder.
2. Codeforces.
3. SPOJ.
4. A2OJ.
5. Codechef.
6. Hackerearth.
7. Hackerrank.

Several languages are available to code. Mainly "C++" is preferred. Next is Java and C. Other languages used are 
Python,PERL, Ruby, PASCAL, C#, Scala, Swift, etc.,

#### Different Topics under problem solving

These are some of the important topics related to problem solving like:

1. Mathematical Concepts like Probability, Combinatorics.
2. Graph Theory.
3. Number Theory.
4. Dynamic Programming.
5. Geometry.
6. Strings.

### Assignment

Solve problems from hackerrank and codeforces in Python/C++. We will be evaluating everyone’s code 
submissions, so please don’t copy the code. Plagiarism is not the way to get into the club. Show us 
what you did and we’ll be happy with it :)
