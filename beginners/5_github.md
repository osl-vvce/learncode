### Introduction
When you ask developers about what a Git or GitHub is immediately they would say *"Its a version control tool"*. So, what is a version control system(VCS)? in layman terms, it is a tool which will help you and your team to work(even remotely) on a particular source code, well how is it gonna help? and the answer is version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, you can turn back to the previous log of code and check for the mistakes and correct it. Github also shows the individual contribution of each person in projects including the number of lines of code he contributed etc.

The most common confusion between beginners is that they think both Git and GitHub are same well, it's not Git works on your local machine and Github is more like a storage facility on the web for your project and it important that you need to know the basics of Git before you jump into GitHub. If you don't know about Git then [please learn it.](https://github.com/amfoss/vidyaratna/blob/master/beginners/2_git.md). This lesson we will help you get familiar with the basics of GitHub.
